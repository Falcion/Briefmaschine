About the project
-----------------

In many other programming languages, JS for an example, there are multiple common output methods for data: from default information output to warnings and errors in console.

Unfortunately, C# doesn't have something like that in its source code and this project delivers solution for this topic - combined with other functionality an advanced logger modulae.

### Built-with

Project was created, inspired and built with this wonderfuls:

- [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
- https://code.visualstudio.com/
- and inspired by: https://www.javascript.com/

Usage
-----

Project, because of its simplicity in common sense, doesn't have any direct idea of usage, but it created to define some processes for your solutions:

- methods to write an colourful output in console of a project;
- implement debug output or just logging process into IO (file-defined) environment: sessions of files system;
- automated constructor for pattern-constructed log messages;

If you want to use this project in your own, just install it in and reference it as namespace: nothing special.

<!-- Contributioning idea:

Contributioning
---------------

Contributions are what make open source community such an interest place to be in - so any form of contribution are greatly appreciated.

If you think that you can help this project become better but think its not so important/realizable in the current situtation or for a full contribution, use issues block, otherwise there is a guideline and policy for contributing.

If you have a suggestion that will improve this project: fork the repository and create a pull request:

1. Fork the repository;
2. Clone the repository with help of any git's client;
3. Make your changes;
4. Stage made changes and push them - [step-by-step guide](https://dev.to/mrfrontend/git-101--step-2-add-stage-commit--push-3p3p) is attached;
5. Create a pull request;
6. Squash commits for cleaner history.

For one-single file contributioning, use a more quicker way without forking the repository through website.

More about it in this article: in [official GIT docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork/) about syncing one-file fork.
