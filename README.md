<!-- Contributioning idea:
 Contributors, contributing guidelines and other: here you can type random 
 contributors or simply write a contributing guideline/reference contributing 
 policy here.
 
 Github is an open source community, so I highly recommend you to setup this 
 block of your project.

Contributioning
---------------

Contributions are what make open source community such an interest place to be in - so any form of contribution are greatly appreciated.

If you think that you can help this project become better but think its not so important/realizable in the current situtation or for a full contribution, use issues block, otherwise there is a guideline and policy for contributing.

If you have a suggestion that will improve this project: fork the repository and create a pull request:

1. Fork the repository;
2. Clone the repository with help of any git's client;
3. Make your changes;
4. Stage made changes and push them - [step-by-step guide](https://dev.to/mrfrontend/git-101--step-2-add-stage-commit--push-3p3p) is attached;
5. Create a pull request;
6. Squash commits for cleaner history.

For one-single file contributioning, use a more quicker way without forking the repository through website.

More about it in this article: in [official GIT docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork/) about syncing one-file fork.
