<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT. -->
<!--
* So here, you need to introduce your project, like in case if you
* want to describe it to someone in hurry-fast situtation. 
 -->

### About the project

Ever thought why C# doesn't colorize some outputs in its console and found doing "debug infrastructure" boring?

Briefmaschine is a library from "maschine"-series which works with custom logging system, allows you to log in colors and input your messages in files!

And there is why this project exists:

<!-- Reasons of project existing: may be useless but steel needed. -->

- A time of programmer should be focused on creating more interesting solutions: maybe even something like this but in more complicated direction.

- Repeating of the same tasks over and over is boring.

#### Built with

Project doesn't have any unique dependencies but built with:

- [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)

<br />

    But user must know at least minimum that he needs to install.
    As I would call it - informational minimum.
 -->

Before using this application, ensure you met this requirements:

- Initialized .NET project in which you would use this library.
- Any potential version of VS: or any other IDE with .NET support.

#### Installation

Permission is granted for free use in any of your projects.

Guide for installation of source code of the class-library:

1. Clone the repository with any form of application that supports GIT.
2. Put this application in your path of project and define its namespace.
3. Class-library is ready to be used in your project.

<!--
    "VS" actually is «Visual Studio 2019/2022» including RC versions.
    Unfortunately, developer doesn't have access to ReSharper, so-
    there is no context about IDEs like it.
 -->
Installation through «Nuget» with help of VS:

1. Open project in VS.
2. In opened project in hotbar find the «Nuget Package Manager» and start to manage extensions.
3. Write the name of this project in the search bar.
4. Download the latest stable version through the menu and class-library is ready to be used.

If you use a different IDE from VS, read this article: [using new commands in .NET][STACKOVERFLOW].

<!-- PROJECT'S USAGE -->
<!-- Comments from the author:
* Write here, an example, where your bot can be used: can add screenshots, codes, demos or links to other
* resources: just scream, how and when reader can use this project.
 -->

Usage
-----

Package is a default-like and you, of course, can write something like this by yourself or this was some day, but this library still does its main functions:

1. automate writing in colourful text in console for better debugging (because C# didn't use coloured console without reason);
2. automatically (by decision) save messages and app's debug history in files (by custom or default path);

<!-- PROJECT'S ROADMAP -->
<!-- 
* Write a long-time roadmap for this project: my direct
* recommendations to not often edit roadmap excluding progress of tasks.
 -->

Roadmap
-------

- [x] Write the primitive core code of the package;
- [x] Write an API documentation within code;
- [x] Design and write a README;
- [ ] Design the repository: issues, attributes and other;
- [ ] Refactor entire project for better readability and view;
- [ ] Design a changelog and write it in;
- [ ] Write the docs.

<!-- PROJECT'S CONTRIBUTING -->
<!-- Contributors, contributing guidelines and other:
* Here you can type random contributors or simply write a contributing
* guideline/reference a contributing policy here.

* this block of your project.
 -->

Contributing
------------

Contributions are what make open source community such an interest place to be in - so any form of contribution are greatly appreciated.

If you think that you can help this project become better but think its not so important/realizable in the current situtation or for a full contribution, use issues block, otherwise there is a guideline and policy for contributing.

If you have a suggestion that will improve this project: fork the repository and create a pull request:

1. Fork the repository;
2. Clone the repository with help of any git's client;
3. Make your changes;
4. Stage made changes and push them - [step-by-step guide](https://dev.to/mrfrontend/git-101--step-2-add-stage-commit--push-3p3p) is attached;
5. Create a pull request;
6. Squash commits for cleaner history;

For one-single file contributioning, use a more quicker way without forking the repository through website;

More about it in this article: in [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork/) about syncing one-file fork.
