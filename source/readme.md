About the project
-----------------

In many other programming languages, JS for an example, there are multiple common output methods for data: from default information output to warnings and errors in console.

Unfortunately, C# doesn't have something like that in its source code and this project delivers solution for this topic - combined with other functionality an advanced logger modulae.

### Built-with

Project was created, inspired and built with this wonderfuls:

- [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
- https://code.visualstudio.com/
- sophisticated with: https://github.com/angular/angular/

Getting started
---------------

Before using this project or working with its source code, read this paragraph so that you wouldn't have unnecessary questions or problems.

### Prerequisites

Before using this application, ensure you met this requirements:

- Any potentional IDE or text-editor with .NET native support (better if with support of NUGET);
- Downloaded .NET SDK on your working machine;
- \* if you desire to contribute to the project, also downloaded [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your machine for integration with commits linting and auto-changelogs;

### Installation

Permission is granted for free use in any of your products.

Guide for installation of source code of the class-library:

1. clone the repository with any form of application that supports GIT;
2. initialize linterns, NPM and HUSKY for commitlintering;
3. make your changes via [contributioning policy and commit convention](#contributioning);
4. work as instructed, class-library is ready to be edited in forked repository;

Instruction about working and setting up automatically linted commits and changelog from them, read - [article about Angular.js conventions](https://mokkapps.de/blog/how-to-automatically-generate-a-helpful-changelog-from-your-git-commit-messages/).

Process of installation within NUGET package manager in VS:

1. open project in IDE with .NET native-support;
2. use the specified package manager in your IDE (in VS - find this in upper hotbar);
3. write the name of this package into packages browser;
4. download the required for you version through the menu and package is ready-to-use.

If you use a different IDE without native support for NUGET, read this article: [using new commands in .NET]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40675162/install-a-nuget-package-in-visual-studio-code/).

Usage
-----

Project, because of its simplicity in common sense, doesn't have any direct idea of usage, but it created to define some processes for your solutions:

- methods to write an colourful output in console of a project;
- implement debug output or just logging process into IO (file-defined) environment: sessions of files system;
- automated constructor for pattern-constructed log messages;

If you want to use this project in your own, just install it in and reference it as namespace: nothing special.

<!-- Roadmap:
 Create, design and write any roadmap you want: you

Contributions are what make open source community such an interest place to be in - so any form of contribution are greatly appreciated.

If you think that you can help this project become better but think its not so important/realizable in the current situtation or for a full contribution, use issues block, otherwise there is a guideline and policy for contributing.

If you want to contribute to this project, please, read contributioning policy and commit convention, this repository works with CLA, commits convention and on automated deployment system.

- [Commit convention](https://github.com/Falcion/Briefmaschine/blob/master/.github/docs/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md);
- [Contributioning policy](https://github.com/Falcion/Briefmaschine/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md);

**For one-single file contributioning, use a more quicker way without forking the repository through website.**

More about it in this article: in [official GIT docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork/) about syncing one-file fork.
